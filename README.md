### My Process

1. Understanding the Design

I started by carefully analyzing the provided design files and breaking down the component into smaller elements, such as:

- Header and title.
- Individual result items.
- Summary button.

2. Structuring the Markup

Using semantic HTML, I structured the component to enhance readability and accessibility. The structure includes:

- A header for the title and description.
- A list to display result items dynamically.
- A call-to-action button at the bottom.

3. Styling with CSS

The design was implemented using:

- Flexbox: For layout alignment and spacing.
- CSS Variables: To ensure consistent colors and spacing.
- Media Queries: For responsive design.

4. Testing and Refinements

After coding, I tested the component on:

- Multiple devices using browser developer tools.
- Different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

5. Deployment

I deployed the project using GitHub Pages, making it accessible online.

### Built With

- HTML5 - For semantic structure.
- CSS3 - For styling and responsiveness.
- GitHub Pages - For deployment.

### What I Learned

Through this challenge, I developed:

- Better Layout Skills: Utilizing Flexbox effectively for component alignment.
- Responsive Design Techniques: Implementing designs that adapt to various screen sizes.
- Attention to Detail: Paying close attention to pixel-perfect design and spacing.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges

- Matching the Design: Ensuring the font sizes, colors, and spacing matched the design precisely.
- Responsiveness: Adapting the layout to fit smaller screens without losing clarity.

### Solutions

- I utilized browser developer tools to fine-tune spacing and alignment.
- Implemented breakpoints with media queries to optimize the design for smaller devices.

### What I’m Most Proud Of

- I’m proud of achieving a visually accurate and responsive component that matches the design specifications while maintaining clean and semantic code.
- What I Would Do Differently Next Time
- Experiment with CSS Grid to explore different layout possibilities.
- Add animations or hover effects for enhanced interactivity.
- Use a preprocessor like Sass to make styling more modular and manageable.

### Areas I Would Like Help With
